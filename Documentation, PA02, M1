PA02 Milestone 1 

	To complete this milestone, we first chose the laptop that we will be using to run vagrant and create the VM. 
  We then installed vagrant on that machine. Then we changed the Vagrant file to allow for shell provisioning 
  and created a bootstrap.sh file to install Python, Java, and ansible when the VM is spawned. Next, we cloned 
  the git repo and added the MyInventory file to the .ansible directory in the vagrant VM. In this file we listed 
  our VMs. We also detailed our private key file in this file. We also had to download the clouds.yaml file and 
  place it in the config/openstack directory. We were then able to use the vagrantup command to spawn the VM with 
  all the necessary installations. We made necessary changes to the ansible.cfg file and /etc/ansible/hosts files. 
  We also can ssh into the cloud VM on Chameleon and ping it.
